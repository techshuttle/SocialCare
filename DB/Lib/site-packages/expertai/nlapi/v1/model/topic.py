        """Initialise the Dependency object

        To minimise the `abuse` of the Python `type` id, the
        initialisation method also accepts `id_`. The former argument
        is used when the initialisation is nested inside other
        data-model classes. In these cases the __init__ receives a
        dictionary containing `type` not `id_`, because that how the
        response the server sends is defined. Otherwise when the object
        can be directly initialised using the second alternative.

        Again, to mitigate this name clash with the reserved keyword
        the property was suffixed with the underscore.
